# Bank Buddy
Project created for Capital One's Software Engineering Summit Hackathon (August 2022)

## Summary
Bank Buddy is an interactive iOS app that gamifies budgeting and teaches financial literacy. Inspired by the classic Tamagotchi, Bank Buddy combines finance and fun in a way that fosters good spending and budgeting habits. With Bank Buddy, our goal is to encourage children and teens to be more financially wary, creating more financially responsible adults in the future.

## How to Use

## Challenges and Accomplishments
During the development of our project, we faced many challenges. However, we are most proud of creating a working product within 24 hours with a team who had no prior experience with iOS development. The final design of our interface is what we had envisioned, which was made possible through successful communication and effective task delegation throughout the entire process. Despite our big learning curve with XCode, the development of Bank Buddy was a very rewarding experience, so please go check it out!
